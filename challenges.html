            </ul>





            <h3>Project Success</h3>

            <h4>Most of the projects in pharma fail</h4>
            <ul>

                <li>We are about to release a webinar with examples of the most dramatic failures in pharma. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>E.g., the need for pregnancy registries, and ethnic diversity programs.</li>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Low adoption of med-tech innovations in pharma</h4>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <h4>Missing negotiation skills to deal with regulatory authorities</h4>

                <li>True Statement</li>
                <li>Our strength is the ability to explain complex scientific issues to authorities. We can provide

            </ul>



            <h3>Business Expansion into Europe</h3>
